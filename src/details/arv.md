# Rabies Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) Guidelines (2014)

## Introduction

Rabies Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is a critical intervention to prevent rabies following potential exposure. The guidelines provide standardized recommendations for the management of animal bite victims, vaccine regimens, and wound care.

---

## Key Principles of Rabies PEP

- **Immediate wound washing** with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.
- **Prompt administration of rabies vaccine** and, if indicated, rabies immunoglobulin (RIG).
- **No contraindications** to PEP, even in pregnancy, lactation, infancy, or old age.

## Categories of Exposure

| Category | Type of Contact | Recommended Action |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| I        | Touching/feeding animals, licks on intact skin | No PEP if reliable history |
| II       | Nibbling of uncovered skin, minor scratches without bleeding | Immediate vaccination |
| III      | Single/multiple transdermal bites/scratches, licks on broken skin, contamination of mucous membrane with saliva, exposure to bats | Immediate vaccination and RIG |

## Indian Government Regimen: Intradermal (ID) Vaccination

> **In India, the Government setup follows the Intradermal (ID) regimen for rabies vaccination due to its cost-effectiveness and proven efficacy.**

### Intradermal Regimen Details

- **Vaccine Used:** Purified Vero Cell Rabies Vaccine (PVRV) or Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine (PCECV)
- **Dosage:** 0.1 mL per ID site
- **Schedule:** 2-site ID injections on days 0, 3, 7, and 28 (Updated Thai Red Cross regimen)
- **Sites:** Usually over the deltoid area of each arm

#### Table: Updated Thai Red Cross (TRC) Intradermal Regimen

| Day | Number of Sites | Dose per Site | Total Dose |
|-----|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| 0   | 2               | 0.1 mL        | 0.2 mL     |
| 3   | 2               | 0.1 mL        | 0.2 mL     |
| 7   | 2               | 0.1 mL        | 0.2 mL     |
| 28  | 2               | 0.1 mL        | 0.2 mL     |

## Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG)

- **Indicated for Category III exposures.**
- **Types:** Equine RIG (ERIG) and Human RIG (HRIG)
- **Administration:** Infiltrate as much as possible into and around the wound; any remaining is given intramuscularly at a site distant from vaccine administration.

---

## Wound Management

1. Wash wounds immediately with soap and running water for at least 15 minutes.
2. Apply antiseptics (e.g., povidone-iodine).
3. Do not suture wounds immediately unless necessary; if required, do so after RIG infiltration.

## Special Considerations

- **Pregnancy, lactation, infancy, and old age are NOT contraindications for PEP.**
- **Immunosuppressed individuals** should receive the full course and may require additional doses.
